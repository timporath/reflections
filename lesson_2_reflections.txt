start a new git repository with command
	git init
use it for version control in your projects
git log with no commits gives an error
use git status to see tracked and untracked files 

the staging area is an intermediary working field between the directory and repository and allows 
the user to specify which files to include in the commit. Since the changes are not done directly the user 
can recover if he makes a mistake.
